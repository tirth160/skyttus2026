# 2. Take user input for two numbers and print their sum. 
# a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# print("Sum =", a + b)
# 3. Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# c = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
# f = (c * 9/5) + 32
# print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", f)

# 4. Store your name in a variable and print it in uppercase. 
# name = "alex"
# print(name.upper())

# 5. Ask the user for their birth year and calculate their current age.

# area = length * width
# print("Area of rectangle:", area)
# 8. Write a program to check if a number is positive or negative.
